this was for the boston key party ctf competition on feb 28, 2014.  
i worked on the "mining your p's and q's" problem.

the problem was based on a paper by zakir dumeric from the university of michigan, which showed how private keys can be extracted from public keys if the moduli are not chosen well (have non-trivial factors in common).  we are given 23 ciphertexts, as well as the public keys with which they were encrypted.  taking advantages of their vulnerablities, we can find the corresponding private keys and decrypt.

i didn't finish in time to compete, but worked on it and finished it afterwards as an exercise.
